        'a40' => 'The financial service industry is the motive force of the global economic development, and it is also one of the industries with the highest degree of centralization. Trade double in the financial market
The asymmetric information of the party leads to the failure to establish an effective credit mechanism. There are a large number of centralization of credit intermediaries and information in the industrial chain.
Mediating, slowing down the efficiency of the system and increasing the cost of funds. <br/>
The open and non tampering properties of the YTC block chain provide the possibility of the centralization of the trust mechanism, with the change of Finance
The potential of the infrastructure, all kinds of financial assets, such as equity, bonds, bills, warehouse receipts, fund shares, etc. can be integrated.
In the book of the YTC block chain, it becomes the digital asset on the chain and stores, transfers, and trades on the YTC block chain. Make it in gold
The application of the melting field has a broad prospect. For example, there are typical cases in cross-border payments, insurance claims, securities transactions, bills and so on
Use. <br/>
In the aspect of (cross-border) payment, the transfer of funds is realized through the YTC block chain technology, especially in the cross-border payment business.
It is particularly prominent in the advantages, to establish direct interaction among the multinational receipts, to simplify the processing process, to achieve real-time settlement, and to improve the exchange rate.
It is easy to be efficient and reduce business costs, thus promoting the development of business models such as cross-border micro payment. Typical application cases are
Visa B2BConnect. The B2B cross-border payment developed by the international bank card organization Visa and the block chain company Chain
The project, scheduled to be launched in 2017, has been tested in 30 banks in 10 countries. Visa and
The block chain system developed jointly by Chain can achieve real-time processing of payment transactions, thus improving efficiency and reducing cost. <br/>
In terms of insurance claims, the insurance agency is the core of the traditional insurance business, which is responsible for the collection, investment and claim of funds.
The cost of management and operation is high. The application of the YTC block chain intelligent contract has neither the applicant nor the insurance company.
As long as the claim conditions are triggered, the claim will be automatically compensated and the amount of the claim is paid. It is difficult to usurp on real data, YTC block chain
The characteristics of the modification can effectively simplify the process of the settlement of the policy, reduce the cost of processing, and reduce the probability of fraud. In addition, through
Through the YTC block chain technology, the digital management of personal data is realized and the information authentication is simplified, which helps to make a clearer disclosure of history
The situation. The typical application case is LenderBot, which was in 2016 by block chain enterprise Stratumn, DDT (Deloitte) and
Lemonway, the payment service provider, allows people to register through the Facebook Messenger chat function.
A customized micro insurance product that is insured for high value items exchanged between individuals, and a block chain is replaced by a loan contract.
Third party roles. <br/>
In the field of securities trading, the traditional securities business requires a deep participation of intermediary agencies in order to effectively complete the issue and exchange of stock.
Easy. Integrating the shares into the YTC block chain to become a digital asset, it can be realized without an intermediary.
Easy. The issuance of assets may be carried out in a confidential or open manner according to the needs. Stock asset transactions are expressed in block chain code
The contract will be completed by each party to realize the automatic execution of the contract, ensuring that the related contracts are visible only between the competitors, but no
Close the third party secrecy. In addition, through the corresponding mechanism to ensure that the issuance and trading of securities meet the regulatory requirements and frameworks, one step will be reduced.
Cost of compliance. The typical application case is the Linq platform, which is co operated by Nasdaq and the block chain enterprise Chain, in 2016
The private equity trading platform, launched in January, promoted private equity to be transferred and sold in a completely new way. Through
The Linq platform Private Equity Issuer enjoys digital ownership, while the Linq platform can greatly reduce the settlement time.
Low capital cost and systemic risk. And the approval process required for the traditional issuance and purchase of materials is also simplified and improved.
Transaction and management efficiency. The identities, trading volume, and other information of the trading party are recorded on the block chain in real time, which is beneficial to the securities issuer.
High decision-making efficiency; a transparent, traceable system for securities issuers and regulators for market maintenance and less dark
Box operation, insider trading and so on. <br/>
In terms of bill, a new digital bill business model is established based on the YTC block chain technology framework, with the aid of distributed high fault tolerance
And asymmetric encryption algorithm can realize the de centralization of the value of the bill, and reduce the transaction center in the traditional business model.
The degree of dependence reduces the operational and operational risks caused by the centralization of the system. Through the programmability of YTC technology, effective control
The mismatch of the assets in the market is controlled by the transparency of the data to promote the authenticity of the market transaction price to reflect the demand for funds.
Market risk. YTC block chain technology can not be tampered with the time stamp and the characteristics of the whole network, to effectively prevent "one ticket selling", "hit".
The endorsement is not synchronous "and so on." <br/><br/>
